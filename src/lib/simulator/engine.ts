/**
 * Pure deterministic simulation engine. No DB, no network, no randomness.
 *
 * ## Simplifying assumptions (documented for honesty about scope)
 *
 *   1. **Flat effective tax rate.** `effectiveTaxRatePct` is applied as a
 *      single household-wide multiplier on gross income. No federal/state
 *      brackets, no FICA, no tax-advantaged account modeling, no
 *      preferential treatment of long-term capital gains or qualified
 *      dividends. Tune the rate to absorb whatever blend matches your
 *      situation.
 *   2. **Single asset pool.** All wealth is treated as one balance growing
 *      at `investment.returnPct` per year (with low/high variants for
 *      the band). No cash-vs-invested split, no bond/stock allocation, no
 *      sequence-of-returns risk. The spec calls this out explicitly.
 *   3. **No Social Security, no pensions, no annuities.** Income outside
 *      the career stages comes only from windfalls.
 *   4. **No mortgage modeling.** A house down payment is just a major
 *      expense; subsequent mortgage payments belong in
 *      `recurringAnnualExpenses` (which inflates with CPI).
 *   5. **Start-of-year growth convention.** Each year, this year's
 *      `investmentGrowth` is computed from the END of last year's
 *      balance, BEFORE this year's contributions, windfalls, and any
 *      shortfall draws. New money therefore doesn't compound within its
 *      first year.
 *   6. **Savings-rate vs expenses cash flow.**
 *      - intendedContribution = afterTaxIncome × savingsRate%
 *      - consumable = afterTaxIncome − intendedContribution
 *      - If expenses ≤ consumable: `saved = intendedContribution`. The
 *        leftover `consumable − expenses` is treated as discretionary
 *        spending (lifestyle absorption), NOT extra savings.
 *      - If expenses > consumable: `shortfall = expenses − consumable`
 *        and `saved = intendedContribution − shortfall`, which can go
 *        negative — that's a drawdown from the investment balance.
 *      - Windfalls always go straight to the balance, untaxed.
 *   7. **Inflation — asymmetric convention.**
 *      - Expenses are paid at the START of each simulation year, so the
 *        recurringAnnualExpenses input is treated as the spend in
 *        horizonStartYear: row 0 has no inflation factor, row N has
 *        `(1+infl)^N`.
 *      - Net worth is measured at the END of each year, one inflation
 *        period later than the start. Real value at row N divides by
 *        `(1+infl)^(N+1)`, so a 10-row horizon shows 10 years of
 *        inflation against 10 years of growth.
 *      - Salaries already grow via `annualRaisePct`; do NOT add
 *        inflation on top — the raise input is NOMINAL.
 *   8. **Real (today-dollars) net worth.** `netWorthRealTodayDollars =
 *      netWorth / (1 + inflation)^(yearsElapsed + 1)` (see #7 for why
 *      the `+1`).
 *
 * The engine is intentionally forgiving about unknown keys on the
 * `Assumptions` object — anything not enumerated below is ignored. This
 * keeps stored scenarios forward-compatible with future engine versions.
