/**
 * Pure deterministic simulation engine. No DB, no network, no randomness.
 *
 * ## Simplifying assumptions (documented for honesty about scope)
 *
 *   1. **Flat effective tax rate.** `effectiveTaxRatePct` is applied as a
 *      single household-wide multiplier on gross income. No federal/state
 *      brackets, no FICA, no tax-advantaged account modeling, no
 *      preferential treatment of long-term capital gains or qualified
 *      dividends. Tune the rate to absorb whatever blend matches your
 *      situation.
 *   2. **Single asset pool.** All wealth is treated as one balance growing
 *      at `investment.returnPct` per year (with low/high variants for
 *      the band). No cash-vs-invested split, no bond/stock allocation, no
 *      sequence-of-returns risk. The spec calls this out explicitly.
 *   3. **No Social Security, no pensions, no annuities.** Income outside
 *      the career stages comes only from windfalls.
 *   4. **No mortgage modeling.** A house down payment is just a major
 *      expense; subsequent mortgage payments belong in
 *      `recurringAnnualExpenses` (which inflates with CPI).
 *   5. **Start-of-year growth convention.** Each year, this year's
 *      `investmentGrowth` is computed from the END of last year's
 *      balance, BEFORE this year's contributions, windfalls, and any
 *      shortfall draws. New money therefore doesn't compound within its
 *      first year.
 *   6. **Savings-rate vs expenses cash flow.**
 *      - intendedContribution = afterTaxIncome × savingsRate%
 *      - consumable = afterTaxIncome − intendedContribution
 *      - If expenses ≤ consumable: `saved = intendedContribution`. The
 *        leftover `consumable − expenses` is treated as discretionary
 *        spending (lifestyle absorption), NOT extra savings.
 *      - If expenses > consumable: `shortfall = expenses − consumable`
 *        and `saved = intendedContribution − shortfall`, which can go
 *        negative — that's a drawdown from the investment balance.
 *      - Windfalls always go straight to the balance, untaxed.
 *   7. **Inflation — coherent end-of-year convention.**
 *      Every value in row i is interpreted as T=i+1 nominal
 *      (end-of-year-i). Concretely:
 *      - Investment growth implicitly converts T=i nominal balance to
 *        T=i+1 nominal via `× (1 + returnPct)`, so balance_end_row_i
 *        already lives in T=i+1 nominal.
 *      - `recurringAnnualExpenses` is the user's spend in today's
 *        dollars (T=0). Row i's nominal expenses apply
 *        `(1+infl)^(i+1)` — the first horizon year is one inflation
 *        period from "now."
 *      - Major-expense and windfall face values are taken as-is in
 *        their row's nominal currency (T=i+1). No internal factor.
 *      - Real (today-dollars) value of anything in row i:
 *        `value / (1+infl)^(i+1)`. Expense column and net-worth column
 *        in the same row deflate by EXACTLY THE SAME factor.
 *      - Salaries already grow via `annualRaisePct` (NOMINAL); don't
 *        add inflation on top.
 *   8. **Real net worth.** `netWorthRealTodayDollars = netWorth /
 *      (1 + inflation)^(yearsElapsed + 1)`, computed from the same
 *      `expenseInflationFactor` variable below to make the coherence
 *      visible at the call site.
 *
 * The engine is intentionally forgiving about unknown keys on the
 * `Assumptions` object — anything not enumerated below is ignored. This
 * keeps stored scenarios forward-compatible with future engine versions.
